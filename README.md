# i achieved all requirements, i struggled with tailwind at first, as i didnt know the tag names but after looking around, i managed to be able to style things how i wanted and i actually ended up prefering it over making css module files.

# i found the stretch goals difficult as i didnt even know where to begin for them, im hoping maybe in a weeks time ill be able to do them.

# i struggled making the sql at first, but implementing it with code wasnt bad, the delete button was grabbing from a previous project so that wasnt bad either, redirecting was new but pretty straight forward, making the data save to the database was the biggest struggle especially the comments and eventually i dont know what i exactly did but it ended up working and i didnt want to touch it, i kept getting an error in the console but im ignoring it as its working.
